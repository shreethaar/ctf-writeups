I recently stumpled upon this cool train! But I'd like to know a bit more about it... Can you please tell me the operating company, model number and its maximum service speed (km/h in regular traffic)?

The flag format is `brunner{OPERATOR-MODELNUMBER-SERVICESPEED}`.
So if the operator you have found is DSB, the model number RB1, and the maximum service speed is 173 km/h, the flag would be `brunner{DSB-RB1-173}`.
