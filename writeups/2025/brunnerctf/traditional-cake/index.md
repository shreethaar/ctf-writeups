# Traditional Cake

I tried this amazing traditional cake at this amazing place I visited... but now I don't remember what it was called and where I was. All I have is this picture I took some time before.

Can you help me find the exact spot I took the image from, so I can try to retrace my steps?

Flag format: Use [what3words](https://what3words.com/) to find the 3-word code for the location (without leading slashes) and wrap in `brunner{}`.
So, if the location found has code `apricot.surfer.uses`, the flag would be `brunner{apricot.surfer.uses}`.
