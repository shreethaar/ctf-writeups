# challenge012

This time, we have captured some network traffic from a website that we think has two flags on it. However, we were not able to filter out unnecessary packets, so you will have to sift through them to find the HTTP packets containing the flags. Good luck! (Haystack.pcap)

- Category: forensic
- Challenge file: Haystack.pcap

### Solution: 

`ctfa{HTTP_FTW}`
`ctfa{HTTP_31337}`
