# challenge008

Description: 

We found the network capture of a possible honeypot attack. Can you help us find out some more information about it?

What is the attacker's IP address?

- Category: forensic
- Challenge file: attack.pcap

### Solution:

1. Open the pcap file
2. Is the same process like before, and u will get the attacker's ip address cuz of more connections in the network

**Flag:** `isfcr{98.114.205.102}`
