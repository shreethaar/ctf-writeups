I found this old VeraCrypt container in my cloud drive. Can't for the life of me remember the password, but I'm sure you can figure out a way. All I remember is that I had a song stuck in my head when I was last working with the volume. How did it go?... "...playing in the street gonna be a big man someday"

HINT: The password is alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), contains no special characters, and the first three characters are gUn.
